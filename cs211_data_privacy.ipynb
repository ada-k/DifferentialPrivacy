    "The clipping parameter is more important for accuracy. The clipping parameter b determines the amount of information lost from the original dataset during clipping thus directly influencing the accuracy of a query.For instance, when the upper and lower clipping bounds are close to each other, a lot of information is lost from a dataset and thus a query's loss of accuracy which outweighs improvement in noise from the same bound-tightness.\n",

    "* **Do you think the answer to the previous point will be true for every dataset? Why or why not?**\\\n",
    "Yes. In some cases, e.g an ML modeling dataset, the scale of noise added may affect accuracy more since differentially private algorithms add noise to the training gradient -the noise can cause the algorithm to move in the wrong direction during training, and actually make the model worse. However, the amount of noise added depends on the clipping parameter b - when the upper and lower clipping bounds are closer together, the sensitivity is lower thus less noise and viz a viz. This therefore still holds the clipping parameter b more important for accuracy.\n"
